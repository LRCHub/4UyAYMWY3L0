See what I believe is
We was granted the power
What's that, the power of what?
The power to make you dance
Like this

I heard she's got a nine to five
But coming in after twelve
I know you're tired of her lies
Just let her go, what the deal
Now take me for instance, babe
See my love will drive you crazy

'Cause I be going boom like an 808
Be makin' circles like a figure eight
You know it feels good from head to toe
Now hold on to me, baby here we go
You be going boom, baby, boom, baby, boom
And I be going ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh
(Check it out)

I heard she's not all that to you
'Cause she can't do it like I do
So put that trophy on the shelf
Go out and find somebody else
Now take me for instance, babe
See my love will drive you crazy

'Cause I be going boom like an 808
Be makin' circles like a figure eight
You know it feels good from head to toe
Now hold on to me, baby here we go
You be going boom, baby, boom, baby, boom
And I be going ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh

Boom like an 808 (boom baby, boom baby)
Circles like a figure eight (circles like a figure eight)
Feels good from head to toe (feels good from head to toe)
To me, baby here we go (now hold on to me baby, here we go)

Ain't nobody can bang it like me
Stack it like me, wouldn't like me
Ask Kelly, his original plan
To get as large on the map, by makin' you clap your hands
Damn shoo, bizzatch, I'm not gonna lie
I'll pump my amps to this
Cutie pie, honey bunch
If you're not busy take me to lunch

Oh, y'all done did it now, with the luscious music
World poppin' crews, and what, 8-0 grooves
To what intended use, yeah you get me up
You wanted to bump and get them 8s
'Cause they ride in my pocket, baby
And today I just wanna jiggle my bump
And knock your socks off
With my what, what, what
Yeah, yeah

Boom like an 808 (boom like an 808)
Circles like a figure eight (circles like a figure eight)
Feels good from head to toe (oh yeah, oh yeah)
To me, baby here we go (get it babe, get it babe)

Boom like an 808 (boom like an 808)
Circles like a figure eight (oh yeah)
Feels good from head to toe (you know it feels good from head to toe)
To me, baby here we go (here we go)

Boom, baby, boom, baby (boom baby, boom baby)
And I be going ooh baby, ooh baby
You be going boom, baby, boom, baby
And I be going ooh baby, ooh baby

Boom like an 808 (boom baby, boom baby)
Circles like a figure eight (what, what, what)
Feels good from head to toe (yeah, yeah, yeah)
To me, baby here we go (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)

Boom like an 808 (boom baby, boom baby)
Circles like a figure eight
Feels good from head to toe
