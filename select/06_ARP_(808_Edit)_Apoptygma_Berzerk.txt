Drag me through the waveless void
Through endless misery
Stay until the end inside of me
Drag me through the waveless void
From endless misery
Take me to the place where I can see you

Drag me through the waveless void
Through endless misery
Stay until the end inside of me
Drag me through the waveless void
From endless misery
Take me to the place where I can see you
